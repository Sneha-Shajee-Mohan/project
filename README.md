 National parks represent the natural and cultural heritage of a nation, offering visitors a glimpse into diverse ecosystems, wildlife habitats, and geological wonders. Our proposed web application, "National Park Explorer," aims to provide users with an immersive experience to explore and learn about the various national parks scattered across the United States. Leveraging Python and web technologies, this application will offer users a convenient platform to discover and plan their national park adventures.

 ## Abstract or Overview
 The National Park Explorer  utilizes data from the National Park Service (NPS) government website, specifically leveraging The National Park Service API, as it offers a comprehensive and reliable source for obtaining up-to-date information to enhance the functionality and richness of our application. 
 This API serves as the backbone of our project, offering a diverse array of datasets ranging from
 park locations, multimedia details, alerts, park boundaries, and fee-passes, weather and contact information related to national parks.
 GOALS:
 The app addresses the inherent challenges and complexities involved in planning and experiencing the vast array of natural wonders and cultural treasures preserved within the National Park System. Our primary goal is to simplify the process of exploring and engaging with these parks, catering to the diverse needs and interests of users and achieving a deeper connection between people and the natural wonders of the United States National Park System.
 KEY GOALS
 Accessibility: We aim to make national parks more accessible to a broader audience by providing comprehensive information and resources tailored to varying interests, abilities, and preferences.
 Education and Engagement: Through curated content, interactive maps, multimedia and other resources, we seek to educate and inspire users about the significance of national parks, their ecosystems, and cultural heritage.

 ## Data Description
 The data used in the National Park Explorer app comes from a DataFrame named df_Park, which contains information about various national parks. Each row of this DataFrame represents a national park and includes details such as the park's full name, park code, description, latitude, longitude, address, contact information, and more. Additionally, the app may also make API calls to fetch additional information such as park alerts and fee information from the National Park Service (NPS) API.

 ## Algorithm Description
 The National Park Explorer code mainly deals with data manipulation, web development using Streamlit, and API integration.
 Data Retrieval: The uses API requests to fetch data from external sources such as the NPS API to retrieve park information.
 Data Filtering and Selection: The app involves filtering and selection of specific park information based on user input (e.g., selecting a park by state). This could be achieved using DataFrame manipulation techniques in pandas.
 Error Handling: The code includes error-handling mechanisms to manage exceptions that may occur during data retrieval or processing. Techniques such as try-except blocks are used for this purpose.
 User Interface Design: The development of a user-friendly interface involves design principles and best practices to ensure an intuitive user experience. This may include layout design, color schemes, and interactive components.

 ## Tools Used
 * Python: Python is the primary programming language used for developing the application. It is known for its simplicity, readability, and extensive libraries for data manipulation, web development, and API integration.
 * Streamlit: Streamlit is a popular Python library used for building interactive web applications with minimal code. It provides easy-to-use widgets and components for creating user interfaces directly from Python scripts.
 * Pandas: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library in Python used for data analysis and manipulation. It is used to handle and pre-process the park data stored in the df_Park DataFrame.
 * Requests: The Requests library is commonly used for making HTTP requests in Python. It is used to fetch data from external APIs such as the National Park Service API.
 * JSON: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format used for transmitting data between a server and a client. It is likely used for parsing and processing data retrieved from external APIs, such as the National Park Service API.
 * Git: Git is a version control system used for tracking changes in the codebase, collaborating with other developers, and managing project history. It helps in maintaining code quality, facilitating collaboration, and ensuring project integrity.
 * Backblaze: The Backblaze application, often referred to as Backblaze Personal Backup or Backblaze Business Backup, is a software application developed by Backblaze that enables users to securely backup their files and data to the cloud.


 ## Ethical Concerns
 Privacy Concerns: While displaying park information, it's crucial to ensure that any personal information collected from visitors or park staff is handled securely and in compliance with privacy regulations.
 Data Accuracy: Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the information presented to users is essential to avoid misinformation or confusion.(All information is collected from NPS.gov website)
 API Usage: App uses data from third-party APIs like the National Park Service API, it's important to adhere to their terms of service and usage policies to avoid any legal issues or violations.
